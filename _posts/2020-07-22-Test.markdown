This is a interactive VR application accomplished with [Angus](https://github.com/aalty) and [Gatto](https://github.com/cating341). We developed a VR application where users can play games, draw on a blackboard, and hold a meeting. Users can also customize their virtual avatar combining with 3D scanning app, and change facial expression with VR controller.
